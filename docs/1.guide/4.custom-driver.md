# Custom Driver  

> You can extend `unstorage` by creating a custom driver.  

Browse [src/drivers](https://github.com/unjs/unstorage/tree/main/src/drivers) to learn how to implement them. The methods can:  

```js  
import { createStorage, defineDriver } from "unstorage";  

const myStorageDriver = defineDriver((options) => {  
  return {  
    name: "my-custom-driver",  
    options,  
    async hasItem(key, _opts) {},  
    async getItem(key, _opts) {},  
    async setItem(key, value, _opts) {},  
    async removeItem(key, _opts) {},  
    async getKeys(base, _opts) {},  
    async clear(base, _opts) {},  
    async dispose() {},  
    async watch(callback) {},  
  };  
});  

const storage = createStorage({  
  driver: myStorageDriver(),  
});  
```  

Some important notes:  

- Keys should be normalized following the `foo:bar` convention  
- Remove any open watchers and handlers in `dispose()`  
- Returning a Promise is optional; you can return a direct value (see [memory driver](https://github.com/unjs/unstorage/blob/main/src/drivers/memory.ts))  
- You cannot access the mount base  
- The value returned by `getItem` can be a serializable `object` or `string`  
- When setting the `watch` method, the default unstorage handlers will be disabled. You need to take responsibility for emitting events in `getItem`, `setItem`, and `removeItem`.
